# Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Projects
My work on course projects for Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree.

The projects have first been copied over from Udacity's [deep-reinforcement-learning](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning) repository. As I go through the course, I'll work on an implementation for each project.

If you're a reviewer, please click on the corresponding project below to find the particular README for that project:
- [Project 1: Navigation](https://github.com/mrbarbasa/drlnd-projects/tree/master/p1_navigation)
- [Project 2: Continuous Control](https://github.com/mrbarbasa/drlnd-projects/tree/master/p2_continuous-control)
- [Project 3: Collaboration and Competition](https://github.com/mrbarbasa/drlnd-projects/tree/master/p3_collab-compet)
